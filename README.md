## XMonad

XMonad is a dynamic tiling window manager written in in Haskell. You can find a good starting configuration [here](https://xmonad.org/TUTORIAL.html).

It's installed via stack so that upgrading my system (*I use arch, btw*) doesn't break the configuration.You can do the same with the [xmonad installer](https://gitlab.com/ciminoV/thinkdots/-/blob/main/xmonad-installer.sh) script I wrote.

I've also configured xmobar with clickable workspaces and dynamic trayer.

## St

St ([suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/)) is a simple terminal emulator.
I copied this build from [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st) with some small change to the font and colors. 

## Zsh

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) is an interactive shell with many features and easily tweakable.

I have autocd and auto-complete, some fuzzy finders useful functions and syntax highlight plugin.

## Nvim

[Nvim](https://neovim.io/) is a Vim-based text editor. My entire configuration is based onthis incredible [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ).

I also have tons of LaTeX snippets inspired by the work of [Giles Castel](https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets). Most of them I copied from this [repo](https://github.com/iurimateus/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim) (You may want to just install the plugin), which is a port of Giles Castel's snippets (who wrote them for UltiSnips) for LuaSnip.
